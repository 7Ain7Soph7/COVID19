# COVID-19 Data Hub <img src="man/figures/logo.png" width="200" align="right" />

_Funded by the Institute for Data Valorization [IVADO](https://ivado.ca/en/), Canada._

The goal of the project is to provide the research community with a __unified data hub__ by collecting worldwide fine-grained case data merged with demographics, air pollution, and other exogenous variables helpful for a better understanding of COVID-19.

**You are welcome to join** and extend the number of supporting data sources as a joint effort against COVID-19.
